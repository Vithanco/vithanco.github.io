I adjust the standard domains for variations whenever it helps me to express myself better. A typical scenario for me is during <a href="https://vithanco.com/concept-mapping-or-the-single-biggest-problem-in-communication-is-the-illusion-that-it-has-taken-place">Concept Mapping</a>, when I want to show that I am unsure whether I understand a Concept well enough. I simply know that I need more input from someone and I want to show this in the diagram with a different Node Type.</p><h2>The Node Type Editor</h2><p>It's simple. I start by viewing the Node Type of a Concept. For this you open the normal Node Editor. Further down comes a button with "View Node Type".</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/viewNodeType-1.jpg" alt="first button to click"/><p class="caption"> <em>View Node Type Button in Node Editor</em></p><p>Once clicked, the Node Type Editor for the Node Type is opened. In this case it is for the "Concept" Node Type.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/Node-Type-Editor.jpg" alt="Changing a Node Type"/><p class="caption"> <em>The Node Type Editor</em></p><p>This Editor is only useable in the full version of Vithanco. Let me explain a bit it's design.</p><ol><li>Here are all <a href="https://vithanco.com/domains">Domains</a> for the document listed. In this case there are two, with the Basic Domain as the first one. The Basic Domain has AND, OR Node Types, but as well notes and problem Node Types.</li><li>The 2nd Domain is Concept Mapping.</li><li>Concept is a Node Type that belongs to the Concept Mapping domain. The remaining dialog shows details of the Concept Node Type.</li><li>A few points are worth noting about this type. Firstly, there is a tickbox to indicate whether this node can be the first one on the canvas. This controls whether you start an empty diagram with this node or not.</li><li>The starting node setting is in this diagram displayed via the Power On/Off symbol. From the symbol an arrow leads to the Node Type. This symbol wouldn't be shown if the node wouldn't be a starting node.</li><li>The rest of this diagram shows the suggested predecessors and successors for this Node Type. The Concept Nodes are always alternating with Relationship Nodes. This is expressed on the Node Type level through predecessors and successor Node Types. Change the predecessors and/or successors and the suggestions (or recommendations) during modelling will change. The diagram here at 6 simply shows these relationships.</li><li>You can change the predecessors and successors here in the editor. (Scroll down a bit).</li><li>If you want to change the looks of the Node Type, select another Type. Concepts are simple rounded boxes with Text in the middle.</li><li>Change Colors in this part. As you can see, the Concept Node Type uses the color with the RGB code 208,236,237. Click and change.</li></ol><h2>The New Node Type</h2><p>I said I wanted to show that I am not sure about a concept. I am going to show this through a yellowish Node Type. Hence, I press the button in the lower part of the middle scroll box.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/Create-Duplicate.jpg"/><p class="caption"> <em>Create a Duplicate of this Node Type</em></p><p>What does this do? It creates a new Node Type with the same settings as the original. I can adjust only the parts that I would like.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/2022-06-02_22-17.jpg"/><p class="caption"> <em>The new Unconfirmed Node Type</em></p><p>What did Change?</p><ol><li>The new Node Type "Unconfirmed Concept" was added to the same Domain "Concept Maps".</li><li>I changed the name to "Unconfirmed Concept" here - which triggered the change under 1.</li><li>I changed the background color here towards a light yellow.</li><li>The Node Type diagram shows the new Node Type. It has duplicated the predecessors and successors of the Concept Node Type. I can therefore use the new type wherever I used the original.</li></ol><h2>The changed Domain</h2><p>In case you wonder about what changed on the Domain level, have a look at the Domain Diagram.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/2022-06-02_22-23.jpeg"/><p class="caption"> <em>The changed Concept Maps Domain Diagram</em></p><p>Please note that many arrows are bidirectional. You start (bottom symbol) with one of the three Concept Nodes, and from there there is only an arrow to Relation. From Relation you can access any of the (now) three Concept Node Types, after which I "return" to a Relation. Hence, I can use the new Node Type where I previously used the other Concepts Nodes.</p><p>I could as well create a new Relation Node Type in a similar fashion.</p><h2>Other Domain Hacks</h2><p>I use this feature regularly for Concept Maps. In fact, I might add the third Node Type to the standard in the future.</p><p>Other Domains can benefit similarly. For example the <a href="https://vithanco.com/domains/project-management-domains/the-benefit-breakdown-structure-bbs-domain">Benefit Breakdown Structure</a> was extended by Disbenefits, HR Enablers, IT Enablers, etc.</p><p>Causal Loop diagrams can as well benefit from different colors if you want to show areas of different departments or similar.</p><p>Finally, the explanations above should encourage you to create a completely new Domain from scratch. Just try it out. Ask, if something is unclear.</p><h2>How to use the new Node Type</h2><p>Now, I can close the Node Type Editor and change the Node Type of the node that triggered my addition to the standard model.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/Change-Node-Type.jpg"/><p class="caption"> <em>The sign post lets you change the Node Type</em></p><p>Press the button in middle, on the left side with the sign post to change the type. You will only get "valid" replacements according to the Domain model. As the help text says, you can override this behaviour by keep pressing CTRL before clicking on the button and you can choose any Node Type, even if that means that your Concept Map is no longer easy to read.</p><p>The outcome for this example diagram is like this:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/2022-06-02_22-35.jpeg"/><p class="caption"> <em>Example Diagram with a new Node Type</em></p><p>Please note, that I am not sure whether Darth Vader is an evil character, which I make clear through the yellow background. No flame war, please.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/methods/typesOfBenefits</guid><title>The different Types of Benefits</title><description></description><link>https://vithanco.com/methods/typesOfBenefits</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 08:35:02 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are all benefits created equal? No! There is a difference whether you can say that you will make one million USD or whether you expect that customers like you better. Not saying that the latter can be even more valuable, but it needs to be clarified what you will get out of this.</p><p>But is it even a benefit to say that customers like you better? The answer is a clear “It depends". It might be all that matters for a small café at the corner of a residential area. But it will be difficult to say how much a customer will like you better if you decorate the café differently. And it will also be challenging to say how your turnover will move by a different decoration.</p><p>But if I am a decorator, then I will happily sell the "benefit" of better-liking customers to the café owner, knowing that I would improve the turnover (and hence profit) with a nice decoration. Conversely, if you decorate a back office, the company’s turnover might not change at all. But maybe the workers feel better? Is that a benefit? Maybe there would be beneficial knock-on effects?</p><h2>What is a benefit?</h2><p>Our definition is quite simple: it is a benefit if you find somebody willing to stand up and say, “This is a benefit" and is ready to spend his money (or reputation, or... ) on it. It doesn't mean you have to deliver the benefit, but there is a benefit, and you have a benefit owner.</p><p>Why is a benefit owner important? If you continue thinking about the café, imagine that the decoration includes flowers or other plants. Someone will need to water them. Someone will need to take ownership of the delivered solution ("decoration") and start working with the delivered solution and realise the benefit (improved customer impression).</p><p>It is a typical situation that a solution delivered will not automatically create benefits. Instead, it will require some change in how the business is run ("care for plants") that will lead to the benefit. And the benefit owner needs to be the person that executes these changed behaviours/processes, directly or via others.</p><p>By the way, it works as well in the other direction: if you go to the team lead and tell her that she can save 10min in a process<br>by making a change to the processes of the team and she ("benefit owner") says no, then we don't consider it a benefit. She won't be willing to push for the changes needed, and the benefit will not materialise, at least not to the expected amount. She might have good reasons for her opinion, and it is worth listening to her argumentation. Was a similar approach already attempted three years ago and failed? Well, what could be done differently this time? And if she thinks that only 5min can be saved with the changes discussed, then the benefit is a 5min saving, not a 10 min. If the benefit owner won't commit, then there is no benefit for the purpose of the project. Ultimately, the benefit owner needs to feel responsible for the benefit if the project starts.</p><p>##Structure to the help</p><p>It helps to think about the different kinds of benefits in a more structured way. The structure allows us to ask the right questions. There is a "hierarchy of benefits". The different benefits are described in the table below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Degree of Explicitness</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Observable Benefits</td><td>Using agreed criteria, specific individuals/groups will decide, based on their experience or judgement, to what extent the benefit has been realised.</td></tr><tr><td>Measurable Benefits</td><td>This performance aspect is currently being measured, or an appropriate measure could be implemented. But it needs to be determined by how much performance will improve when the changes are completed.</td></tr><tr><td>Quantifiable Benefits</td><td>Sufficient evidence exists to forecast how much improvement/benefit should result from the changes.</td></tr><tr><td>Financial Benefits</td><td>A financial value can be calculated by applying a cost/price or other valid financial formula to a quantifiable benefit.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A measurable benefit is also observable, a quantifiable benefit is measurable, and a financial benefit is quantifiable. We all want to have well-defined financial benefits for every project. But actually, that is seldom the case.</p><p>We have seen a business case based on a clear financial benefit. The story was similar to this: The project team promised to shorten the time to do X from 20 min to 4min. We have Y people working on doing X. The expectation was that the workforce could be reduced by 80%, amounting to a large annual sum of Z. The project was "successful" in delivering the change, shortening the execution time of X from 20min to 4min, which summed up to a vast sum of minutes saved by the hundreds of executions per day. However, the financial benefit didn't materialise. As a consequence of the now reduced time to execute and the resulting faster turnaround, more people requested the work from the team in question. Ultimately, the team needed to grow to fulfil the significantly increased demand. Therefore, key stakeholders considered the project a big failure as the benefit wasn't delivered. But the project did exactly what it was supposed to do. It would have succeeded based on a quantifiable benefit of execution time(20min down to 4min). Financially (within the agreed measure, team size), it failed. Unfortunately, the project team couldn’t pinpoint a financial benefit steaming from a faster execution rate. And those weren’t part of the KPIs anyway.</p><p>A lesson from the story, always include a measure of the executions of X, not just whatever you measure about X. And you should consider whether a change of X might lead to a change in the number of executions.</p><h2>What is the task of the benefit owner during the project?</h2><p>Ultimately, our benefit owners will need to stand up for the project and the impact on their respective benefits. The project cannot change a team size; that can only be the person responsible for delivery who should therefore be our benefit owner. Hence, they have a unique role in project success and should be treated as such.</p><p>Projects often take months or years. I have seen a project being silent for over a year and then presenting a "solution” to an unprepared benefit owner. The solution didn't match its expectations, and the benefit disappeared whilst looking at it.</p><p>What to do? Turn it around! If you identified the benefit owners early on, you must work with them throughout the project. Keep the benefits owners informed during the process and double-check whether the proposed solution fits the problems. Make changes to the solution if needed. Adjust benefit size if required. But ensure throughout the process that you have the goodwill of the benefit owner (and still a viable project). Without them, the benefit will not realise. You will need the full buy-in at the time the solution is ready. Or you could provide them with more but more minor changes, already testing the impact of later steps. This will provide you with significant insights for the rest of the project.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/notations/Change/benefit-breakdown-structure</guid><title>The Benefit Breakdown Structure (BBS) Notation</title><description></description><link>https://vithanco.com/notations/Change/benefit-breakdown-structure</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 05:53:21 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Why using the BBS Notation?</h2><p>Benefit Breakdown Structure diagrams are useful to plan and execute projects. A BBS diagram follows the <a href="https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit2.php">Start with the end in mind idea:</a> We should start with analysing the intended benefits and then simply plan backwards:</p><ol><li>What is the strategic intend or investment objective? Why are we looking at planing a project? This should be a linkage to the overall company strategy. I am particular fond of the idea of calling a project an investment.</li><li>What are the associated benefits? By looking at the project proposal and matching the investment objective, what benefits can we aim at?</li><li>Which (business) processes will need to change for realising each benefit? Please note that a benefit is not created during the project. Instead a changed process will create the benefits each time it is executed. So, which process is creating the benefit? It doesn't have to be a formal process, it doesn't even need to be executed twice. But both is often enough the case.</li><li>What one-off changes are enabling the changed processes? This is ultimately the task of the project.</li></ol><p>Often enough we plan a project the other way around: one starts with an idea of a new technology/system/product idea and then try to find the benefits for that. I believe that here is one of the root causes for many failed projects. Someone fell in love with an idea, not with a benefit.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/BBS-Schema.jpg"/><p>An example for a BBS diagram that explains some of the key concepts.</p><p>The diagram above is created with this Notation. It shows how the structure of a (rather small) project could look like. The clusters are used to explain how the diagram translates into a project environment.</p><p>A better understanding of the underlying ideas of benefit realisation through a BBS can be found at the <a href="https://kneupner.de/thoughts/benefit-realisation">author's web site</a>.</p><h2>Notation Definition</h2><p>The Notation contains a Node Type for each of the questions raised earlier.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/domain-BBS.jpg"/><p>The Benefit Breakdown Structure Notation</p><p>There are a few notes to make:</p><ul><li>You will never define the whole structure from the objective to the enablers. It is absolutely fine to include as well planning in the other direction. You even need to in order to identifier dis-benefits which normally always happen.</li><li>I was considering to provide many similar nodes, like "IT Enablers", "HR Enablers", "Financial Benefit", etc. but didn't do so. Simply create a Node Type duplicate and adopt to your needs.</li><li>If you follow the planning as suggested will you realise that the shape of the diagram should be a triangle, as there will be more and more entries the further you are away from the investment objectives. If this is not the case for your diagram then you might overlook something.</li><li>This approach is easily aligned with Agile approaches. You can create a rough Business Case for each benefit and then compare each in-project business case. Focus on the best benefit and change the process. Once you are done you can re-evaluate the BBS and select the next benefit. Looking from this angle, a benefit becomes a feature.</li><li>Keep the BBS updated throughout the project. It will guide you. E.g. when you learn that a benefit is actually smaller than expected and you consider the benefit as no longer worth enabling then the BBS will allow you easily to de-scope those enablers that were in the plan only for this benefit.</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>Node Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Is <a href="https://vithanco.com/Tools/Help/dictionary%23StartingNodeType">Starting Node Type</a> / Successors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Investment Objective</td><td>Investment Objectives are the goal of the initiative.

What benefits can we achieve that support the investment objective?</td><td>No / Investment Objective</td></tr><tr><td>Business Change</td><td>Business Changes are changed processes that create the expected benefit by execution. Please note that a benefit is not created during the project. Instead, a changed process will create the benefits each time it is executed. Which process(es) is (are) creating the benefit?

However, one of the main obstacles with diagrams can be its size. It is not uncommon for us to have diagrams with wy over 100 nodes and over 150 edges. If you plan a project with the <a href="https://vithanco.com/notations/Change/benefit-breakdown-structure">The Benefit Breakdown Structure (BBS) Domain</a> then this represents only a small project. The resulting BBS is quickly becoming messy to look at and the overlapping of edges means that the main diagram is rather confusing.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/big-diagram.png"/><p><em>A large Diagram (modified BBS model)</em></p><p>Generally speaking, size can be a limitation to a graph's usefulness by making it difficult to understand the structure. If the graph is too complex and the connections are going crossing many times then the structure is difficult to understand. And if the diagram is not suitable for meaningful communication then it is rather useless. If one large diagram isn't explaining the full story, then we need to provide ways in which to show relevant parts.</p><p>How can one manage the full big picture and can still zoom into aspects in Vithanco? Or to ask metaphorical: How can one see the forest/woods and the trees? This post provides some answers.</p><h2>Cluster and Cluster Folding</h2><p>The first approach includes an element of diagrams that is sometimes overlooked: Clusters. A Cluster is basically a part of the diagram (a subgraph) that is drawn together, is visually emphasised with a different background and has a name.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/BBS-Schema.jpg" alt="BBS Example"/><p class="caption"> <em>A diagram with three "open"/"unfolded" clusters</em></p><p>The above diagram has 3 clusters, each one drawn around the different node types. However, if you fold each cluster (and ensure that you use a strict graph) then you get something similar to the below. The nodes within each cluster are "hidden" away, but can easily retrieved by a mouse click (use the folding map symbol button).</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/BBS-schema-folded.jpg" alt="BBS-schema-folded"/><p class="caption"> <em>A diagram with three "folded" clusters</em></p><p>So, first way to keep the overview: create folders and hide some areas that you currently don't need. Clusters are generally a good idea to make a diagram better understandable.</p><h2>Focus View</h2><p>Working on a diagram requires to change perspective. Sometimes you need to see the whole and sometimes you need to see only a small part and focus on it. It can be a few nodes, it can be a predecessor Tree. And it is simple with Vithanco to switch perspective. Select the nodes that you need and click the "Focus on Selection" toolbar button. The main diagram will be replaced with the subgraph that contains only the selected nodes. In the top right corner will be a "return to full graph" button. You can manipulate the subgraph in the same way as the full graph and changes to the subgraph will be applied to the full graph too.</p><p>Within the Focus on Selection View is it easy to review a specific part. Nodes that otherwise might be spread across a big diagram will be located together and the structure can be reviewed. This became such a standard way of graph manipulation that we added shortcuts for selecting nodes easier.</p><ul><li>mouse click: select/deselect clicked node</li><li>[Shift] + mouse click: select predecessor tree</li><li>[Shift] + [Opt/Alt] + mouse click: select sucessor tree</li><li>[Opt/Alt] + mouse click in Node Statistics: select/deselect all Nodes of the clicked Node Type</li></ul><p>Especially the last one allows to quickly create views with the right content. Thinking of the BBS structure mentioned above. Clicking on "Investment Objectives" and "Benefits", then choosing "Focus on Selection" allows us to see the value proposition of an initiative even if the diagram itself became big.</p><p>Second way of keeping the overview: whenever you need to look at some parts in more detail use the focus view.</p><h2>Reports</h2><p>Reporting is another way of digesting a large diagram. Reporting allows to slice and dice the information and to make it digestable. The right report depends on domain and the use and Vithanco's reporting is accordingly flexible. This is how it works.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/reportMenu.png" alt="reportMenu"/><p>For a <a href="https://vithanco.com/notations/BBS/benefit-breakdown-structure">BBS</a> diagram we normally look at the the benefits of a project/change initiative and how to enable each benefit. It is often the right way to deliver one benefit after the other instead of delivering many at once. So, the natural way is to select a benefit and it's predecessor tree and to enable the benefit through delivery of benefits. But how to choose the next benefit? Here, the report becomes useful. <img src="https://vithanco.com/images/reportSettings.png" alt="reportSettings"/></p><p>Choose the Report Menu and select "Detailed Report By Node Types". In the following dialog choose "Benefit" as the Node Types and choose "Node Itself" and "Predecessor Tree". Clicking Ok will create the report. That is a document that contains a dedicated diagram for each benefit. Each benefit diagram will contain the predecessor tree for that benefit alone.</p><p>The resulting Report will be created as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown (.md) document</a>. Choose an appropriate tool to convert Markdown to other formats if needed. Share the document with everyone interested. They won't need Vithanco in order to digest the report.</p><p>Third way of working with large diagrams: create useful reports to see each facet.</p><h2>Table View</h2><p>Another useful way to handle complexity is to use a different way to present the information. Vithanco offers a table view to ignore the edges and to focus on the nodes alone. Each Node becomes a row in a table. Use this tool to quickly change node texts, etc.</p><p>The Table View will present the selected nodes only. If no node is selected then it will present all nodes. As selection of specific Node Types can happen quickly through the Node Statistics (see above, [Opt/Alt] + mouse click selects/deselects all Nodes of the clicked Node Type) the Table View can be used to quickly review all nodes of particular Node Types.</p><p>The forth way to switch between the whole and details is a different presentation of the diagram: a table.</p><h2>Bonus: Automatic Highlighting of Connected Nodes</h2><p>Especially when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)">degree</a> of the Nodes (vertexes) is high the resulting diagram will have overlapping edges. Vithanco highlights the connected Nodes for each Node/Edge when you move the mouse, allowing to follow the particular edges easily.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Vithanco provides tools that make it possible to "zoom" into details and out again.</p><ul><li>Cluster Folding</li><li>Focus View</li><li>Reports</li><li>Table View</li></ul><p>Use these tools to deal with large diagrams.</p><p>If you have questions and/or improvement ideas then please <a href="mailto:support@vithanco.com">reach out to us</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/tools/Help/Expert_Concepts/connect-your-diagram</guid><title>Connect your Diagram</title><description></description><link>https://vithanco.com/tools/Help/Expert_Concepts/connect-your-diagram</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 05:53:21 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vithanco allows to connect your diagram easily with other relevant resources as long as it can be referenced via a URL.</p><h2>How to add URLs?</h2><p>Just add a URL to a Node in your diagram in the Node Editor.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/2019-05-05_07-05-27.png"/><h2>How to use URLs?</h2><p>Hoover over the node.

But this is not how it works for most Structured Visual Thinking Methods.</p><p>So, if I get the story right, then around 2000, Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, sat in a restaurant after a meeting where he and his team discussed “Business Flywheels”. So he decided to do a flywheel on his own, famously on a napkin, and the outcome looked like this:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/methods/CLD/amazonsFlywheel.jpeg"/><p>What does this picture mean?</p><blockquote><p>Bezos and his lieutenants sketched their own virtuous cycle, which they believed powered their business. It went something like this: lower prices led to more customer visits. More customers increased the volume of sales and attracted more commission-paying third-party sellers to the site. That allowed Amazon to get more out of fixed costs like the fulfillment centers and the servers needed to run the website. This greater efficiency then enabled it to lower prices further. Feed any part of this flywheel, they reasoned, and it should accelerate the loop. — Brad Stone, The Everything Store</p></blockquote><p>I hope this makes sense to everyone. And over 20 years later, one can see how this was successful. Fuelled by initial growth, the gravitation towards Amazon continued, and Amazon became one of the most profitable companies in the world. The growth was reinforced by what the company did.</p><p>But what kind of diagram did Jeff draw? It is a “lazy” version of a so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop_diagram">Causal Loop Diagram (CSD)</a>, as it is often used in the domain of Systems Thinking. CSDs are very simple to draw and can provide tremendous insights.</p><p>CSD are about what is technically called “stocks”. A stock is anything that can be counted: people, money, roads and windows or things that can be (even poorly) quantified, like goodwill, health, etc. The important part is that you can still make assessments like “sports will improve your health” while “a bag of crisps does affect your health negatively”. Then you think about how these stocks are influencing each other. Assuming stock A is increasing, what would be the impact on stock B? To stay in the previous example: “If you do more sports, then it will improve your health”, which includes as well the opposite statement “If you do fewer sports, then your health will decrease”. Side note: both statements are more generically true than always in every case. I don’t talk about extremes, like extreme sports, that might become unhealthy. But for most of the population, some sports would be good; more would be better. The other way to influence is a negative influence. The more crisps you eat, the less healthy you will be (again, on average). The following graph shows this basic understanding:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/methods/CLD/Health.png"/><p>This simple graph has three “stocks” and two “edges” or connections connecting the stocks. The connections are labelled with s for “same” direction of influence and o for “opposite” direction of influence.</p><p>This is nice, but it doesn’t deliver much value yet. It becomes more interesting when you create loops. Assuming a bank account in times of normal interest rates (interest &gt;0). If you have money in your account (a stock), then you will get Interest paid on money on the account (another stock). The direction of influence is “same”. More money in the account delivers more interest. Interest, by the way, goes back to the account. So, there is another influence. This looks like this:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/methods/CLD/CompoundInterest.png"/><p>What you see here is that we have created a reinforcing loop. If you don’t influence this system in any way, you will have a runaway system that will produce more and more money on the account, which is basically what we understand under compound interest. Vithanco highlights this loop with a circle in the direction of the loop and the letter R for the reinforcing type of the system.</p><p>There are two types of loops: reinforcing and balancing, based on the number of opposing connections.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Loop Type</td><td>Description</td><td>Behaviour</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Balancing</td><td>Balancing loops have an odd number of opposite connections.</td><td>Balancing loops are associated with reaching a plateau.</td></tr><tr><td>Reinforcing</td><td>Reinforcing loops have an even number of opposite connections (please note that zero also is even).</td><td>Reinforcing loops are associated with exponential increases/decreases.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Add a few more stocks, and you can start analysing complex systems. But already simple models can show the complexity of situations. Let’s review the Adoption Model.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/methods/CLD/Adoption.png"/><p>The model is about adopting any new trend/product/service. It has two loops that influence the overall adoption rate. Suppose the adoption rate won’t change, and the pool of potential adopters doesn’t change. We will experience an exponential increase in adopters until the small remaining stock of potential adopters keeps the adoption rate low.</p><p>Coming back to Amazon’s flywheel we started with. I recreated it in <a href="https://www.vithanco.com/">Vithanco</a> and it looks like this (please note, that I changed the model slightly, as the stock is “prices” and “costs” instead of “lower costs” and “lower prices” and hence two connections became opposite):</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/methods/CLD/JeffBezosFlywheel.png"/><p>Now you can see what the business flywheel is about. It’s nothing else than a reinforcing loop. A loop that made Amazon one of the most successful companies of these days. And if we compare this with the adoption model from above then we can see why Amazon’s growth stopped. Jeff Bezos didn’t include the balancing loop from the Adoption Model in his diagram. The market was so big for him in 2000 that he didn’t need to think about it. But after 20 successful years of exponential growth, the stock of potential adopters got smaller and smaller.</p><p>I will talk more about Causal Loop diagrams, but for now, I suggest the excellent introduction from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems">Donella Meadows’ Thinking in Systems</a> for further reading.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/methods/self-coaching-with-ibis</guid><title>Harness the Power of Self-Coaching to Tackle Complex Issues</title><description></description><link>https://vithanco.com/methods/self-coaching-with-ibis</link><pubDate>Fri, 7 Jul 2023 06:21:04 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we try to understand a complex issue in our heads, we often end up in “rabbit holes”: <em> We follow a chain of questions until we forget how we came to this particular follow-on question. </em> We need to maintain the context of the question and look at a minor aspect of the issue - without even realising that it is insignificant. * We cannot see whether we worked on the most critical subquestion. In short, we can only think about a complex issue partially through in our heads. And this is not surprising, as study after study shows that we can only keep a few “chunks” of information in our brain at the same time (see, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two</a>).</p><p>Over time we might work complex issues out in our brains, but there is no guarantee that we see all options and that we don’t already start looking for evidence instead of searching for new aspects (see, for example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">Confirmation Bias</a>).</p><p>This post might help you, too. The topic is “self-coaching”.</p><h2>What is Self-Coaching?</h2><p>Self Coaching is a term that describes methods that apply two-party coaching methods to a single party. In short, you become a coach and coachee in one person. Type “self-coaching” into your browser’s search bar, and Google will tell you it has about 348 million hits (May 15th, 2023). So, it seems to be a big thing.</p><p>As a coach, you generally don’t give advice; you listen and ask. The coachee needs to deliver all answers to themself. The clue is to ask the right questions and let the coachee find the way forward. Questions should be void of judgement and open up new ways of thinking for the coachee. Often enough, the <a href="https://kneupner.de/visual-thinking-library/the-coaching-habit">best questions are straightforward</a>. My favourite is “What else?”, a simple question to trigger more answers.</p><p>I tried self-coaching in my head, with moderate success, as I tend to end up in the rabbit hole, as I already mentioned. But having a visual representation of the questions and relevant answers did help me to overcome this and other issues.</p><h2>The Notation</h2><p>I am drawing IBIS diagrams (see example) to support my self-coaching. IBIS diagrams consist of 4 elements:</p><ul><li>Questions</li><li>Answers or Ideas</li><li>Pros (comments supporting an answer or idea)</li><li>Cons (comments that show opposing sides of answers or ideas)</li></ul><p>Answers/solutions answer questions; answers/solutions can have Pros and Cons. In addition, questions can be attached to any element. You can question a question (“Why is this relevant?”), or an idea (“Is this realistic?) or pros and cons (“Do we have data for this?”). These four elements are used by a method called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/325731.Dialogue_Mapping">Dialogue Mapping</a> to map out full dialogues between a group of people. See IBIS Domain for more details on how Vithanco supports self-coaching, and read the example graph below for a quick understanding of IBIS.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/methods/Self-coaching-with-IBIS.jpg" alt="Example of an IBIS diagram"/><p class="caption"> <em>Use visuals to help you during self-coaching</em></p><p>There is also a simple way to use IBIS without any visuals. You simply use a text editor and write one “box” per line. <em> Questions end with a questions mark </em> Answers are indented under the question <em> Pros and cons are further indented, starting with “+” or “-“. </em> Further questions add to the indention. With these rules, the above diagram will look like this: ￼</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/methods/Self-coaching-as-text.png" alt="Same content as before, just as text"/><p class="caption"> <em>Same content as in previous picture, but expressed as text instead of visuals</em></p><p>Please note how the structure of the thoughts is expressed via increasing indent. This simple format can help you to structure your thoughts even on a piece of paper.</p><h2>The Method</h2><p>Just follow this simple process. Adapt it to your needs wherever you think it would be good.</p><ol><li>Brain Dump: Start by noting down the Question you want to get answered (the root question). Provide a first set of answers/solutions. In the next step, you add obvious Pros and Cons. If you already have relevant follow on questions, just add them potentially with answers.</li><li>Review your questions: Now, you step back and start reviewing your questions and add additional questions to the right node if they add value. Some suggested review questions are:<ul><li>Are these the right questions? Especially the root question could be easily not aligned with your goals. If you are unsure, add a “Is this question aligned with xxx?” to the diagram.</li><li>What are the evaluation criteria? Based on what criteria do you prefer one answer over the other? Add the criteria as well to the diagram.</li><li>Are the questions open? Closed questions are narrowing possible answers. Try to reformulate</li><li>Are the questions rhetorical or leading? Make the question more open. If needed, then add the hidden evaluation in the criteria for answers (see above).</li><li>Are all terms clear? Similar to the criteria, sometimes it is required to define a term on the fly. Add the question if you think that a different definition is possible and that a different definition can impact the evaluation of answers. 3. Review your Pros &amp; Cons:</li><li>Are the Pros &amp; Cons valid? Feel free to add questions about sources for the data or whether you can trust the data.</li><li>Are the Pros &amp; Cons lack criteria? If you like/dislike an answer, based on what criteria do you think that answer is good?</li><li>What other Pros &amp; Cons do you see 4. Add more answers:</li><li>Just ask yourself the magic question: “What else?”</li></ul></li></ol><p>Iterate points 2 - 4 until you are happy with the outcome. Eventually, you will have reflected enough, and your inner coach will stop asking questions. You will conclude the matter and can be sure that you did a reasonably good job. Clearly, sometimes you will want to review your IBIS graph with others. You will find that others are easily able to trace your thoughts if presented with an IBIS graph. And, of course, external input can add important thoughts, leading to further iterations.</p><p>An added advantage of this method is its longevity. You can revisit your IBIS diagram years later and still understand the logic behind your past decisions. This can be a powerful tool for learning and growth.</p><h2>Bonus Thoughts</h2><ul><li>It is impossible always to request an outsider’s opinion. You will likely not challenge all your assumptions. It takes training even to see a few of your premises. Hence, a coach is always a good idea in a critical situation. But the diagram lets you quickly shore up your train of thought with the coach.</li><li>No article should be written touching the topic of decision-making without mentioning the book “Decisive” by the Heath brothers (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15798078-decisive">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15798078-decisive</a>).

Developed by Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt, TOC is a set of problem-solving tools, one of which is the Thinking Processes.</p><p>The Thinking Processes are a set of tools to help managers walk through the steps of evaluating a problem, developing a solution, and planning to implement the solution. When constructing a logic tree within the Thinking Processes, these eight categories are used to scrutinize and challenge the logic of the tree's constructs.</p><ol><li><strong>Clarity</strong>: This category ensures that any word, idea, or causal relationship is entirely understood and unambiguous. It underlines the importance of making any diagrams or trees clearly understandable to all, even those not involved in their creation.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Entity Existence</strong>: This reservation is about confirming that the entity in question actually exists within the problem-solving or analysis scope. It helps avoid the pitfall of introducing unproven assumptions while building logical Thinking Processes trees.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>Causality Existence</strong>: This reservation involves validating whether the cause indeed results in the cited effect. This involves vocalizing the relationship as, for example, "if A exists, then B exists" or "to have B, A must be present".</li></ol><ol start="4"><li><strong>Cause Sufficiency</strong>: This checks whether a cause (or set of causes) is, on its own, enough to produce the effect. In intricate systems, various independent causes may result in an effect, or multiple causes may combine to create an effect. Should a legitimate cause be unknown or overlooked, the proposed solutions might not always prevent the effect, hence the importance of listing all causes.</li></ol><ol start="5"><li><strong>Additional Cause</strong>: This reservation probes for any other cause that could lead to the same effect but hasn't been mentioned yet.</li></ol><ol start="6"><li><strong>Cause-Effect Reversal</strong>: This aims to address any potential mix-up between the cause and its effect.</li></ol><ol start="7"><li><strong>Predicted Effect Existence</strong>: This category explores an additional, expected, and verifiable effect from a specific cause. It supplements the validation of causality existence: if the cause leads to another predictable effect, it is valid; if not, the cause's existence is likely invalid.</li></ol><ol start="8"><li><strong>Tautology</strong>: Also known as circular logic, this checks if the effect is the only and inadequate evidence provided for the existence of a cause. This tends to happen when the cause is less tangible, like in the statement, "I fervently wished for good weather, hence the weather was good because of my fervent wish".</li></ol><p>Each category is used as a checkpoint to test the validity and integrity of the logic constructs within the thinking processes. They provide a systematic way to scrutinize and validate the logical structure of a problem and its solution, enhancing decision-making and strategic planning.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/methods/Find-your-Leverage-Point</guid><title>Find your Leverage Point with Current Reality Tree</title><description></description><link>https://vithanco.com/methods/Find-your-Leverage-Point</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 06:14:51 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to start</h2><p>Today, we are looking at identifying the leverage point when you can't see the wood for the trees.

The proissuesblems, or let's call them Undesired Effects (UDEs), that I had were:</p><ul><li>Too much to do</li><li>Spending time on the wrong things</li><li>Too little progress</li><li>Feeling Exhausted</li><li>Putting myself under pressure</li><li>Working long hours Clearly, the list could be longer, including family time, etc. Please note that they are all about me and how I fail at my goal of being more productive.

And clearly, some things are just a things that I can't change, like the weather, or the fact that I have to sleep. We will call these things "Given". They can be a cause for a UDE, but they can't be changed.</p><p>So, you start connecting them and you might get a graph like this:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/Methods/LeveragePoint/CRT_no_priorities_2.svg" alt="UDEs"/><p class="caption"> <em>Partically connected graph with my UDEs</em></p><p>In this incomplete graph, we only have 2 UDEs that don't have a cause (at the bottom). Clearly, this graph is only valuable if we build something that is grounded in reality. What is needed whilst we connec the graph is that we</p><ul><li><strong>Challange each connection:</strong> Is there a real cause and effect relationship? Is A always leading to B or is there another cause needed? It is easy to connect things that sound ok. We should be sure that it is the case.</li><li><strong>Challange each new box:</strong> Especially when we go for feelings and emotions, we should be sure that we are not just making things up. We should be able to explain why we feel a certain way. If we can't, we should not add it to the graph.</li><li><strong>Identify other reasons:</strong> If we can't find a cause for a UDE, we should ask ourselves if there is another reason. Maybe we are just not aware of it. Maybe we are not ready to admit it. But we should be sure that we are not missing something. In the language of the graph: even if we have a A -&gt; B connection that we are sure is correct, we should still ask ourselves if there is another reason for B. If we find one, we should add it to the graph as a C -&gt; B connection. You can always delete C later if it isn't helping you to connect the graph.</li></ul><h2>Finding the Leverage Point</h2><p>Eventually, my graph looked like this:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/Methods/LeveragePoint/CRT_no_priorities.svg" alt="UDEs"/><p class="caption"> <em>The final graph</em></p><p>So, here we have a graph that is connecting all UDEs and we have one UDE marked as a Changable. And if you look at the graph, you see that this is the only UDE that is causing all other UDEs, this is my leverage point. The leverage point was that at that time of life I simply didn't prioritize my work. And without a clear prioritisation:</p><ul><li>I was working on the wrong things</li><li>I was working long hours</li><li>I was putting myself under pressure</li><li>I was feeling exhausted</li><li>I was making too little progress and I had too much to do.</li></ul><p>One can see in hindsight how indeed all these issues are clearly connected to a lack of prioritisation. If we now define priorities the whole situation will improve. Most likely, a set of priorities will quickly lead to regular time planning in order to make sure that the priorities are met first. So, there is still work to be done, but by using the leverage point, all of the other issues can be solved if you keep on working dilligently and use the insights gained by the exercise.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>So, what did I do?</p><ul><li>we started with a list of UDEs</li><li>we connected them to a logical graph, where each connection A -&gt; B means that A is causing B</li><li>we identified the leverage point as a changable problem that is causing all other UDEs</li></ul><p>You might ask, is this even possible? Could it be so simple that all my problems are caused by a single problem? Well, there was a condition that you need to meet in order for this to work: The UDEs need to be related to a single goal. If you have a set of UDEs that are related to different goals, then you will have multiple leverage points. And if you have multiple leverage points, then you need to find a way to prioritize them. Or you need to create a goal encompassing both goals. But that is a different story.</p><p>Clearly, this is a simplified version of the method. The more detailed version will be on https://vihanco.com/mehtods/Find-your-Leverage-Point.html soon.</p><p>If you ever worked in a complex environment then you know that it's not that easy to find the root cause for an issue. What do you do find the root cause for an issue? Fishbone diagram? Sharp Thinking? Trial &amp; Error? <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/vithanco/p/the-power-of-perseverance-unleashing">5 Whys</a>?</p><p>Finding your Leverage Point is maybe the most versatile of them all! The starting point is slightly different from other approaches. Instead of looking at one problem in isolation, Find your Leverage Point is looking at the whole environment and identifies the point with the highest leverage. This makes sense as most issues are interconnected. And here is the fundamental difference to most other approaches. Most other approaches are looking at a single problem and help you fixing that particular issue. You will feel good about fixing an issue, but you might not see any change in the big scheme of things.</p><h2>Simplicity</h2><p>The idea behind "Find you Leverage Point" is from Eliyahu Goldratt. His believe was that in any system only a few things needs to be changed in order to improve the situation significantly. The theory of constraints (TOC) is one of his examples for this. For TOC he showed how work on a single point (the constraint) leads to improvements of the whole system. (see for example <a href="https://vithanco.com/notations/TOC/index">my introduction to TOC</a>. The full idea regarding simplicity is nicely written down in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Choice_(Goldratt_book)">The Choice</a>.</p><p>The book The Choice by Goldratt argues that all problems can be solved more easily than expected when viewed from the right perspective. Moreover, many problems often trace back to a single root cause. Fix this root cause, and the entire situation improves. This article is all about finding that key leverage point.</p><h2>Current Reality Tree (CRT) Explained</h2><p>The right notation is key for effective problem-solving. We're going to use the <a href="https://vithanco.com/notations/TOC/current-reality-tree">Current Reality Tree (CRT)</a> - a tool developed by Eliyahu Goldratt, which helps trace problems back to their root causes. A CRT is a visual map of our current issues (termed "Undesirable Effects" or UDEs) and their underlying causes. By following the trail of causes and effects, we can target the root causes for effective solutions. CRT follows the <a href="https://vithanco.com/tools/Help/Expert_Concepts/diagram-logic">sufficient cause logic</a> from the Theory of Constraints (TOC) thinking processes. Simply put, if a cause is confirmed, then the effect is confirmed too.</p><p>Let's explore the different elements of a CRT: | Node Type | Description | | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Undesirable Effect | Starting points in a CRT, symbolizing unwanted outcomes caused by other factors. | | Intermediate Effect | Outcomes neither good nor bad, but caused by other factors. | | Desirable Effect | Goals to be achieved, caused by other factors. | | Given | Constants or unchangeable conditions, like gravity. | | Changeable | Conditions that can be modified to prevent issues from recurring. | | And Junctor | Shows that an outcome occurs only if two conditions are met. |</p><p>The CRT is fundamentally about identifying causes and effects, and discerning what can be changed and what cannot.</p><h2>How to find your Leverage Point</h2><p>To create a CRT, you first identify the Undesired Effects (UDEs) that you are experiencing. List them first, with a suggestion of between 5-10 These are the symptoms of the problem that you are trying to solve. Once you have identified the UDEs, you can begin to identify the underlying causes. These are the factors that are contributing to the UDEs.</p><p>CRTs are typically drawn as a tree, with the UDEs at the top, and the underlying causes at the bottom. The underlying causes are connected to the UDEs by arrows, which show the causal relationships between them.</p><p>Once you have created a CRT, you can begin to develop solutions to the problem. The solutions should address the root causes of the problem, not just the symptoms. By addressing the root causes, you can achieve lasting improvement.</p><p>Here are some of the benefits of using CRTs:</p><p>They help you to identify the root causes of problems. They help you to develop solutions that address the root causes of problems. They help you to improve the performance of systems. They help you to think more systemically. They help you to communicate your ideas more effectively. If you are looking for a powerful tool for problem-solving, then the CRT is a great option. It is a simple tool to use, but it can be very effective in helping you to identify and address the root causes of problems.</p><p>The process is complete when all UDEs are connected, and you can identify the single effect that requires modification for the most significant impact.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/methods/why-consultants-should-use-concept-maps</guid><title>Fast-Track to Understanding Your Clients: The Freelancer's Secret</title><description>Dive into the world of Concept Mapping - a secret weapon for freelancers and knowledge workers to swiftly understand clients and get a head start on new engagements. This article illustrates the power and simplicity of Concept Maps in cutting through jargon, aligning perspectives, and fast-tracking your productivity, all while showcasing your value from day one.</description><link>https://vithanco.com/methods/why-consultants-should-use-concept-maps</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 06:09:41 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you looking to cut down on your initial engagement timeline and start delivering real value to your clients from day one? Freelancers and knowledge workers, this one is for you!</p><p>We've all been there. New client, new jargon, and everyone seems to have their own unique interpretation of certain terms. I recall when the simple term “chassis” was borrowed from the automotive world and used in a project I was working on. It seemed straightforward initially, but the more people tried to explain it, the fuzzier it became. Some saw it as the whole software ecosystem; others viewed it as an abstraction layer. The confusion was rampant, but everyone was unknowingly talking past each other, slowing down the project significantly.</p><p>Here's where I pulled out my secret weapon - the Concept Map. Have you never heard of it? Let me enlighten you. A Concept Map is a visual tool that helps define and clarify terms or concepts by illustrating their inter-relationships. Think of it as a simplified diagram that anyone can grasp within a few minutes. It’s as easy to create as a Mind Map - you just put concepts in boxes and draw lines between them, accompanied by relevant verbs or prepositions.</p><p>Take a look at the example below:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/1st-Concepts.png"/><p class="caption"> <em>Three Simple Concept Maps</em></p><p>This illustration shows three basic concept maps, each featuring two concepts linked by a relationship. Each connection narrates a story, such as “Concept A relates to Concept B”, “a dog is a mammal”, or “The library card is needed to borrow library books”. The brilliance of Concept Maps lies in their simplicity and ability to be easily modified based on new or corrected information. A bigger Concept Map on the topic of this article may look like this:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/methods/Freelancers.svg"/><p class="caption"> <em>Concept Map for Freelancers, based on this article</em></p><p>Remember the chassis conundrum? I followed the <a href="https://vithanco.gumroad.com/l/yglaj">Align Stakeholders Method</a>: I drew a Concept Map with two individuals with similar interpretations of the term. As I presented it to more people, the differences in understanding surfaced, sparking some challenging yet productive discussions. Eventually, we ended up with a comprehensive Concept Map featuring 40 concepts, encapsulating the team's unified vision of "chassis." As a result, we saved at least a month of back-and-forth and set a trend of creating a Concept Map for every initiative. Or so we thought because when I presented the map to senior management and asked for their feedback, they were "not amused". We needed to further align our understanding with them (the creators of the Chassis concept) and save even more time because it turned out we were working against leadership’s intentions.</p><p>Simply put, a Concept Map is a practical tool that reveals discrepancies in understanding. And guess what? It’s super easy to use, making it an excellent tool for alignment in complex environments, potentially saving days or even months.</p><p>As freelancers or knowledge workers, starting a new engagement can be daunting. Utilising Concept Maps accelerates your understanding of the task and may help you identify and rectify misalignments.</p><p>But there's more to it! By reflecting on your understanding of the client, discussing its correctness, and delivering your first piece of actual work within the first few days, you establish a solid foundation for your engagement and demonstrate your immediate value.</p><p>Want to master the art of Concept Mapping? Don't hesitate to reach out!

Picture yourself as Sherlock Holmes, but you’re hunting down elusive root causes instead of solving high-profile crimes. Like any good detective, you will need more than the initial explanation. Let's face it; the first layer is often just a smokescreen for the real culprits lurking beneath. Your weapon of choice? The disarmingly simple question: "Why?"</p><p>Imagine your car, a trusty old gas guzzler, refuses to start one fine morning. Ask, "Why?" The answer: a dead battery. Now, you could stop there, rope in a mechanic, and get it fixed, but would that truly resolve the issue?</p><p>Let's probe deeper. "Why is the battery dead?" A defective alternator is to blame. But wait, what led to the alternator's downfall? "Why isn't the alternator working?" Ah, the alternator belt is broken.</p><p>We're getting somewhere now, but hold on! Have we indeed unearthed the root cause? Replacing the broken belt could give your car a new lease on life, but that's akin to treating a symptom, not the disease. What we're after is a behaviour change that we have control over and can be addressed to prevent future issues.</p><p>"Why did the alternator belt break?" you ask. The belt had served beyond its expected lifespan and hadn't been replaced. So now we're onto something. "Why wasn't it replaced?" Because, in truth, the vehicle has yet to be maintained as per the recommended schedule. Bingo! We've struck gold.</p><p>Regular vehicle maintenance is a behaviour we can alter. The earlier stages in our line of questioning led us to uncontrollable variables, but by persevering with our "whys," we found a point of intervention. Maintenance might cost a pretty penny, but isn't it better than footing the bill for an emergency repair?</p><h2>Unveiling the Method</h2><p>This root cause analysis unfolds beautifully when depicted visually, and the <a href="https://vithanco.com/notations/IBIS/index">IBIS notation</a> serves as an ideal framework. Our detective journey can be traced in a simple, structured graph, bringing clarity and order to problem-solving. <img src="https://vithanco.com/images/methods/5Whys.svg" alt="5Whys example"/><p class="caption"> <em>Our investigative journey from issue to the root cause, presented visually</em></p></p><p>So, why the <strong>5</strong> in 5 Whys? It's a heuristic, a general rule that reminds us to dig deeper than our instincts suggest. You might strike root cause gold on your third "why," or perhaps you'll have to excavate to the eighth. The magic number five encourages you not to settle for an easy answer. Keep digging until you unearth a changeable behaviour which allows you to barricade the path to recurring issues.</p><p>Interestingly, the 5 Whys method has its roots in the Toyota Production System, a brainchild of Sakichi Toyoda, founder of Toyota Industries. It has since been embraced by various businesses and industries worldwide, offering a simple, accessible, and practical approach to problem-solving.</p><p>Despite its straightforwardness, it's crucial to acknowledge the 5 Whys method's potential limitations. It hinges on the people’s knowledge and insight in the process. If they comprehensively understand the problem or the knack for discerning root causes, the method may uncover the underlying issue. In such cases, more sophisticated problem-solving tools might be worth exploring.</p><h2>Bringing it All Together</h2><p>A <strong>root cause</strong> is a behavioural origin of the problem that you can rectify.</p><p>The 5 Whys method is all about:</p><ol><li>Identifying the problem.</li><li>Asking "why" the problem happened.</li><li>Probing deeper with each informative response by asking "why" again.</li><li>Persist with the "whys" until you discover a root cause or have exhausted your lines of inquiry (in which case, seek more perspectives or try a different method).</li><li>Upon hitting the root cause, devise strategies to avert the problem's recurrence.</li></ol><p>In conclusion, the 5 Whys method is more than a problem-solving technique; it's a journey into the heart of issues, unmasking behavioural culprits and empowering us to take effective action.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/methods/AlignStakeholders</guid><title>Align Stakeholders</title><description>A method that will help you to ensure that all parties are fully aligned on whatever you do, whether it is operations or change.</description><link>https://vithanco.com/methods/AlignStakeholders</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 06:09:41 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can purchase the method <a href="https://vithanco.gumroad.com/l/yglaj">here</a> or if you would like to get more <a href="https://vithanco.gumroad.com/l/hynwy">support</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/notations/IBIS/index</guid><title>The IBIS Notation</title><description>The IBIS notation allows to to drill down on any problem and answer all relevant questions by only four Note Types: Questions, Answers, Pros and Cons.</description><link>https://vithanco.com/notations/IBIS/index</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 17:12:39 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Why using IBIS?</h2><p>I use the IBIS to describe itself.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/Why-and-when-IBIS.jpg" alt="Why using IBIS Notation?"/><p class="caption"> <em>Explaining IBIS with IBIS</em></p><p>Issue-based information systems (IBIS) can display any conversation or thought process. The notation itself is straightforward. IBIS diagrams have only four node types: questions (everything can be questioned), answers/ideas as responses to questions and arguments for each of these answers and ideas. Adding questions to every other node allows you to explore each part of the diagram in any depth needed or wanted.</p><h2>IBIS Notation Definition</h2><p>The graph below describes the IBIS Notation. The Question Node Type is the starting point (hence the edge from the start symbol). From the question, you can create a successor Idea. Pro and Con Nodes can follow ideas. Questions can be successors to all Node Types.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/IBIS-Domain.jpg"/><p class="caption"> <em>The IBIS Notation structure</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Node Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Is Starting Point</th><th>Successors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Question</td><td>Questions are the key driver of IBIS.

However, IBIS Notation can be used for all issues, whether wicked or not.</p><p>Use Vithanco to create and change IBIS diagrams to map out a dialogue/argumentation or a thought/analysis. It uses a simple structure to help you get to the bottom of your problems.</p><p>The IBIS Notation is a simple graphical presentation of questions and answers with their respective advantages and disadvantages with the following rules:</p><ul><li>A question can have any number of answers or ideas.</li><li>Any answer/idea can have any number of arguments for each answer, split into the two categories of pros and cons.</li></ul><p>The result is a simple graphical representation of a question. You can use it for any question and briefly explore a topic. It interests all those who prefer a visual representation instead of a textual description.</p><p>The concept of the IBIS notation is deliberately kept simple to make it worthwhile for many use cases. The only so-to-say “complication” is that you can attach a question to any other item. As such, you can:</p><ul><li>question a question (“Shouldn’t we rather discuss X?” or “What are the assumptions behind this question?”), or you can</li><li>question an answer (“To follow this idea, what would we need to take into consideration?”, “What proof do we have for this statement?”), or you can</li><li>question pro or con (“What could we do to overcome this disadvantage?”).</li></ul><p>Each question would have its own structure with answers/ideas and pros&amp; cons. And, of course, can these have further questions attached? Nothing restricts how big the IBIS diagram might become. You, as the creator, decide how many questions you want to include asks and how “deep” you want to go with your diagram to analyse the topic at hand.</p><h2>Further Information</h2><ul><li>Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system</a></li><li>Working Paper (1970): <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.134.1741&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Issues as Elements of Information Systems</a> by Werner Kunz &amp; Horst Rittel</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19093260-dialogue-mapping?from_search=true">Dialogue Mapping</a> by Jeff Conklin</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/notations/TOC/index</guid><title>The Theory of Constraints (TOC) Thinking Processes</title><description>An overview of the Theory of Constraints (TOC) Thinking Processes and how they can be used.</description><link>https://vithanco.com/notations/TOC/index</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 16:27:35 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a management paradigm that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. There is always at least one constraint, and TOC uses a focusing process to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it. TOC adopts the common idiom "a chain is no stronger than its weakest link". That means that organizations and processes are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them, or at least adversely affect the outcome.</p><p>TOC was developed by Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt, an Israeli physicist, and is based on the idea that every system has at least one constraint that limits its performance. The goal of TOC is to identify and manage these constraints in order to improve system performance.</p><p>TOC is a powerful tool for improving the performance of any system, from a small business to a large organization. It has been used successfully in a wide variety of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and service industries.</p><p>The five steps of TOC are:</p><ol><li>Identify the system's goal.</li><li>Identify the system's constraints.</li><li>Decide how to exploit the system's constraints.</li><li>Subordinate everything else to the decision in step 3.</li><li>Elevate the system's constraints.

I will add some better examples here over time:</p><ul><li><a href="https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.tocico.org/resource/collection/B6E9C93D-AFC5-407E-9D8B-AD70D0AEAFE0/Mabin,_Vicky_TOCICO_2013_TP_Basics_English_Final_plus_bio%28FINAL2%29.pdf">TOC ICO: TCO TP Basics Workshop (Vicky Mabin)</a></li><li>www.lomag-man.org/normes/normes_isa/documents/2002-05-ISAD12.ppt</li></ul><h2>Theory of Constraints in simple terms</h2><p>Theory of Constraints (TOC) was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_M._Goldratt">Eliyahu Goldratt</a>. The basic idea of TOC is that in a production the slowest work step will determine the overall output. If you want to increase the overall output then you need to increase the throughput on the slowest work step, which is ultimately constraining the whole production.<br>If you produce too many goods before the constraint, that is the slowest work step, then you will just have more work in progress but not more output. Managing the work in progress will eventually even decrease your output. You should therefore adjust your work load before the constraint to the amount of the constraint, even if that means that the machine utilisation will go down. Please note, that if you increase the throughput at the constraint then another work step might become the constraint. But by definition there is always at least one constraint.</p><p>If you improve a step that is not the constraint then you won't impact overall output.<br>If the work step is before the constraint then you increase work in progress (WIP) creating a problem of ever more WIP that might need to get stored etc. If the improvement was behind the constraint then the work step will do the same amount of work in shorter time - but there won't be more work to do. Machine utilisation might fall - after you invested into that step.</p><p>Obviously, many production processes are not plain linear, with many variations and different stations for the same work step, etc. Hence it is not always obvious where the constraint is at any given time and it might be that for different products different work steps become the constraint, in which case the product mix has an impact on production output.

Then...' statements to address 'WHAT to change?' They serve as the initial step in applying the TOC thinking processes, leading to the discovery of the root cause – the single item to change for the most significant impact.</p><p>Essentially, CRTs are a form of root cause analysis. They assume that even if numerous problems exist in a specific area, they all stem from one or a few root causes. CRTs model the cause-and-effect relationship between these problems (known as "Undesirable Effects" or UDEs) and their causes.</p><p>What sets CRTs apart from other root cause analysis methods is the underlying <a href="https://vithanco.com/tools/Help/Expert-Concepts/diagram-logic">sufficient cause</a> or <a href="https://vithanco.com/tools/Help/Expert-Concepts/diagram-logic">diagram logic</a>.

CRTs begin by listing the known Undesirable Effects (UDEs) in a specific area. It is recommended to collect between 5 and 10, but more can be included if necessary.</p><p>Next, follow the sufficient cause logic to identify the causes. Each cause is an effect in itself (desirable, undesirable, or intermediate). Two additional "causes" typically appear at the bottom of the diagram: "Given" causes, which cannot be changed, and "Changeable" causes, which can and should be altered to mitigate problems from reoccurring.

The nodes are created in an order and this is the first order used. By maintaining that order Vithanco ensures that the nodes are located where they are and that small changes in the input leads to only small changes in the output. That means that in most cases the leftmost node stays leftmost. The layout algorithms are stable in the sense that they produce the same outcome for the same input. And the order of nodes is part of the input.</p><p>And sometimes the original order is not the order you like. You would like the nodes presented in a different order, exchanging two nodes that are located next to each other, or similar.</p><h1>The Solution</h1><p>You can change the order of nodes and thus can influence the resulting diagram by using the [TAB] key. Simply select two nodes and press [TAB] and the two nodes exchange their place in the order of nodes. If you select more than 2 nodes and press [TAB] they are rotating their position in the order. Finally, press the [ALT] (or [OPTION]) key at the same time as [TAB] and the order is shuffled.</p><p>You can use [TAB] in all diagram types.</p><h1>Limitations</h1><p>Sometimes the algorithm will not be influenced by a change of order. 'Good reasons' might keep the layout algorithm from changing the diagram if the order of nodes changes. Examples of these 'good reasons' may:</p><ul><li>to avoid long edges (aka connection)</li><li>to avoid crossing edges, or</li><li>to place nodes within a cluster next to each other,</li><li>to balance a tree based on the next layer (layered view only),</li></ul><p>or similar. The above list is not complete and the used algorithms are quite sophisticated.</p><p>There are more ways to influence a diagram but these will be captured in another post.</p><h1>An Example</h1><p>The following is an example with a "<a href="https://vithanco.com/notations/causal-loop-diagram">Causal Loop Diagram</a>" or "CLD" in short. Causal loop diagrams are used to analyse systems and their behaviour.</p><p>CLDs aren't layered as they are normally full of cycles ("loops"), meaning they have a lot of connections that would point from the bottom to the top. Hence CLDs use a star layout.</p><p>The example is based on the "<a href="http://www.systems-thinking.org/theWay/ssb/sb.htm">Shifting the Burden</a>" archetype. The first version looked like this:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/2019-03-09_17-17-40.png"/><p>The structure of this CLD archetype is not very obvious. Edges are overlapping, making the understanding unnecessarily difficult.</p><p>Using the above, select the top and the right node:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/2019-03-09_17-18-51.png"/><p>Now press [TAB] and the order of the two selected nodes is exchanged, resulting in a different positioning of these nodes in the internal order. In this example they simply exchanged their location as well.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/2019-03-09_17-19-13.png"/><p>Now the structure becomes clear. The edges are no longer overlapping and the three loops become visible.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/tools/Help/Expert_Concepts/Vithanco-url-schema</guid><title>Vithanco's URL Schema</title><description></description><link>https://vithanco.com/tools/Help/Expert_Concepts/Vithanco-url-schema</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 05:59:59 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vithanco has a URL schema allowing to create a new document with a specific domain.</p><p><a href="vithanco://?command=newDocument&domainID=com.vithanco.domains.ibis">vithanco://?command=newDocument&amp;domainID=com.vithanco.domains.ibis</a></p><p>On a Mac with Vithanco installed the URL above creates a new document with the IBIS domain.

CLDs explain long term behaviour of systems which is otherwise difficult to understand based if you only look at the current as-is snapshot.</p><p>CLDs describe systems via "stocks" (nodes) and (edges). Much of the day-to-day world can be accurately described as such a system. Let's look at a simple example: A bank account and the interest earned.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/2019-03-19_09-39-50.png"/><p class="caption"> <em>Banking Account as a simple Causal Loop Diagram</em></p><ul><li>The amount of the Bank Balance (a stock) will affect the amount of the Earned Interest (another stock), as represented by the connection, pointing from Bank Balance to Earned Interest.</li><li>Since an increase in Bank balance results in an increase in Earned Interest, this link is of the same kind, meaning more results in more. Interestingly, this even works for a negative amount in your bank account.</li><li>The Earned interest gets added to the Bank balance, also a link of the same kind, represented by the bottom connection.</li><li>The causal effect between these nodes forms a positive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcing_loop "Reinforcing loop"">reinforcing loop</a>, represented by the icon in the middle containing an "R" and showing the loop direction (clockwise).</li></ul><p>This system is obviously only a part of bigger system that would include salary payments and withdrawals to live. But if left alone, the reinforcing loop points out that this system would lead to an uninterrupted growth of the two stocks involved.</p><p>A CLD is very useful to identify the loops that affect the systems' behaviour. Especially the separation between balancing and reinforcing loops provides meaningful insights into a system's behaviour as shown in the following table.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Loop Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Behaviour</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Balancing</td><td>Balancing loops have an odd number of opposite connections (negative links).</td><td>Balancing loops are associated with reaching a plateau.</td></tr><tr><td>Reinforcing</td><td>Reinforcing loops have an even number of opposite connections (negative links,</td><td>please note that zero also is even). Reinforcing loops are associated with exponential increases/decreases.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>CLD Notation Description</h2><p>CLDs have only one single node type. Add more node types if you want to differentiate further. Easiest way is described <a href="https://vithanco.com/help-and-explanations/create-a-node-type-variant">here</a>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Node Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Is Starting Point / Successors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Everything is a stock in a CLD. Stock amounts can change over time, based on incoming connections.

Being less hungry is a direct consequence. Eating is sufficient to reduce hunger (ignoring some psychological effects). In comparison, preparing food is not sufficient. You can prepare food and not eat it. That leads to necessary conditions.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/2018-11-04_20-25-32.png" alt="In order to vote, I must be 18 years old and I must be registered"/><p class="caption"> <em>Necessary Condition Example</em></p><p>It is not sufficient to be 18 years old, you need as well in order to be registered in order to vote.

This purchase represents a significant expense. There are numerous ways to approach this decision, from simply winging it to turning it into a well-structured project.</p><p>If I were to buy a car, my approach might resemble the following (read from left to right):</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/BuyingCar.svg"/><p class="caption"> <em>An Impact Map for Buying a Car</em></p><p>This Impact Map would be a work in progress until I purchase the car. Up to this point, I have identified various stakeholders (referred to as "actors" in Impact Mapping, such as car dealers) and considered how they can assist me (e.g., by providing discounts) and what actions I need to take to obtain their help. It's worth noting that not all potential assistance will be necessary. However, this map outlines the primary activities that could bring me closer to my goal of buying a car.</p><p>Does that make sense? Here is a more systematic description of a method that is most times used by Product Owners.</p><h2>Why Impact Mapping?</h2><p>Impact Mapping offers numerous benefits for Product Owners and teams:</p><ul><li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Impact Mapping is a highly collaborative process that involves stakeholders, Product Owners, and development team representatives, fostering productive discussions and shared understanding.</li><li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The method helps teams identify the most valuable features, saving time and resources by prioritising what matters most.</li><li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Impact Mapping ensures that every feature contributes to the overall goal, keeping the team focused on the big picture.</li><li><strong>Assumption Testing:</strong> The map highlights the assumptions made during the planning process, enabling teams to design experiments to validate or refute them.</li></ul><h2>The Impact Mapping Process</h2><p>Typically, the impact map is created in a workshop setting with relevant stakeholders and team representatives. Participants collaborate to identify the following elements, one level at a time:</p><ul><li><strong>Goal</strong>: Start by clearly defining the primary objective. It should be an actual goal, not a deliverable (e.g., "6 million weekly signed-in users" instead of "New sign-in system"). Avoid over-specifying the task with a plan to achieve the goal. For instance, "Getting more customers by creating a mail-based marketing campaign on X" is not a good starting point. Instead, use broader goals like "Getting more customers," which allows flexibility in choosing whom to involve, how to involve them, and what support is needed.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Actors</strong>: Determine the users and other parties who might be impacted by the product (e.g., signed-in users, guest users, customer services). These actors can either help or hinder your initiative. As Gojko Adzic, the inventor of Impact Mapping, puts it: "Whose behaviour do we want to impact?". Be specific when identifying actors. For example, instead of generic terms like "Friend," use actual names. Distinguish between "secondary actors" who provide services and "primary" actors whose goals directly impact the final goal.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Impacts</strong>: Assess how actors can help achieve the goal, prevent it, or be otherwise impacted. Ask yourself, "How should our actors' behaviour change?". In some cases, this might involve one-time changes, like providing requirements. In others, such as improving a website, the desired change may be repeatable, like encouraging visitors to spend more time on the site.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Deliverables</strong>: List what can be delivered to achieve or mitigate impacts. This includes features and other actions like recruiting additional support staff. The critical question is, "What can we do to support the required impacts?".</li></ul><p>Consider your Impact Map a living document. Keep it updated when you get new ideas, when features are delivered and especially when you learn something new.</p><h2>From Impact Map to Backlog</h2><p>An impact map can facilitate meaningful discussions and decisions during its creation and when reviewing the results. Some examples include:</p><ul><li>Descoping features that don't fit into the impact map and therefore don't contribute to the goal, saving effort and resources.</li><li>Adjusting the priority of deliverables contributing to a particular impact based on its importance.</li><li>Comparing multiple features contributing to the same impact and prioritising the one with the most significant potential contribution.</li></ul><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>The value of impact maps extends far beyond prioritising features against one another. The exercise helps generate features in the first place while ensuring that each one contributes to the goal. Moreover, impact maps reveal the assumptions made during the process, enabling teams to validate them.</p><p>For further reading on impact mapping, consider Gojko Adzic's book, "Impact Mapping," and Magnus Dahlgren's article on <a href="https://medium.com/@MagnusDahlgren/determining-value-using-impact-mapping-e5c3216f66c2">Determining Value Using Impact Mapping</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/methods/Resolving-Conflicts</guid><title>Define the Problem Before Solving It: How to Resolve Conflicts Constructively</title><description></description><link>https://vithanco.com/methods/Resolving-Conflicts</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 13:44:02 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, we will learn how to constructively resolve conflicts so that they don't resurface in a slightly different form shortly after.</p><p>The great Einstein was asked: "If you have one hour to save the world, how would you spend that hour?" According to legend, he responded, "I would spend 55 minutes defining the problem and then five minutes solving it." While there is much doubt whether Einstein said this, defining the problem before solving it is widely accepted as sound advice. A quick Google search for "define the problem before solving it" yields over 485 million results, indicating that this principle is crucial in problem-solving.</p><h2>Why define the Problem first?</h2><p>So, why define the problem first? Defining the problem allows us to focus our efforts, resources, and time in the right direction. With a clear understanding of the problem, we can save resources on irrelevant solutions or even worsen the problem.</p><p>By defining the problem, we can clarify the goal, identify constraints, gather relevant information, and develop a plan of action. Defining the problem ensures that we focus our resources, time, and energy in the right direction, leading to more effective solutions and better outcomes.</p><h2>Define the problem in case of a Conflict</h2><p>Now, let's talk about conflicts. Conflicts can be found everywhere, whether it's at home or work. It's fair to say that conflicts are worth solving, but how do we solve them? We can solve conflicts by adding a step of first defining the underlying problem of the conflict.</p><p>We must look beyond the current actions and understand the underlying motives to do them. The visual Evaporating Cloud is a tool that helps us do just that. The Evaporating Cloud is part of the <a href="https://vithanco.com/domains/the-theory-of-constraint-toc-thinking-processes">Theory of Constraints (TOC) Thinking Processes</a> and is also known as the Conflict Diagram. It resolves conflicts by stating both sides of the problem and reviewing the underlying assumptions that create the conflict.</p><p>The idea behind the Evaporating Cloud is that as long as everyone has a shared goal, there cannot be an unresolvable conflict—instead, every perceived problem results from at least one faulty assumption. Therefore, if all conflicts are founded on false assumptions, removing the conflict requires identifying assumptions which are too often not voiced. Once we find the wrong assumptions, we can readily identify and permanently mend problems.</p><p>To define the problem of the conflict between two parties, we define the problem as follows. First, we start by identifying the shared objective. This sounds more difficult as it is: companies want to be profitable, couples want to be happy together, etc. If we cannot identify a shared objective, inventing one that both sides can agree is normally possible. Next, describe each party’s specific goals (or “needs”). Then we map out the specific actions of each side in the diagram ("wants"). The outcome will look similar to the diagram below.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/EvaporatingCloud.png"/><p class="caption"> <em>The basic structure of the Evaporating Cloud</em></p><h2>Solve the Conflict</h2><p>Based on this graph, we can identify the underlying assumptions that led to the conflict. Once we have identified the assumptions, we can challenge them and find a solution that satisfies both parties. The result is a win-win solution that is better than any compromise.</p><p>The visual model we've established serves as a tool to expose underlying assumptions. Therefore, it’s crucial to identify and examine these assumptions individually since each can guide the solution in a different direction.</p><p>If done correctly, both parties will endorse the solution, and the problem won't resurface in a slightly different form shortly after.</p><h2>Example Conflict</h2><p>To give it more meat, let's look at an example. Let's look at a mid-sized specialised production business. A worker with special skills (let's say quality assurance of melding via X-ray) is sick for a few weeks and needs a short-time replacement. Imagine a finance department that needs to reduce costs and an operations (=production) department that needs to maintain quality. One side wants to pay less for the staffing, and the other wants the take the first good enough candidate. The conflict diagram would look like this:</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/EvaporatingCloudFinanceVsOperations.png"/><p class="caption"> <em>An example conflict</em></p><p>We can see how the two departments want opposing actions and that they both want it for good reasons. So we could now start to compromise and agree on numbers, like: "We will interview five candidates, shortlist two and take the cheapest”, or "After one week of unsuccessful searching for cheap temp workers, Operations has free hands".</p><p>But there are better solutions than this. The best solution is to find the underlying assumptions. In this case, some underlying assumptions are: <em> <strong>Delaying onboarding can be absorbed by Operations.</strong> Just because it worked out in the past doesn't mean it will work out in the future. Even more so, there might be a hidden cost for paying overtime or losing a customer. </em> <strong>We can only find temp staff members after we need them.</strong> The formal contract with the right temp agency can solve this, or at least make it someone else’s problem. * <strong>Finding more Candidates takes longer.</strong> This is not necessarily true. We can use a temp agency or a headhunter to find more candidates in parallel. The only extra time it would cost is the time to interview the candidates. In most cases, this is a good investment.</p><p>The Diagram with the underlying assumptions would look like this: <img src="https://vithanco.com/images/EvaporatingCloudFinanceVsOperations2.png"/><p class="caption"> <em>An example conflict with some underlying assumptions</em></p></p><p>These assumptions can resolve the conflict and fix the situation without compromise. Often they can be combined and create an even better solution. For example, we could agree to use two temp agencies we will ask in case of need and create a framework contract allowing us to onboard a temp worker within 48 hours, which is acceptable to Operations. This would solve the problem without compromise and be cheaper than the original solution.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We started with the idea that defining the problem before solving it is good. We then examined how to define the problem in case of a conflict. We saw that the Evaporating Cloud is a tool that helps us do just that. An Evaporating Could diagram represents the problem in a visual, condensed manner. The diagram supports resolving conflicts by stating both sides of the problem and allows reviewing the underlying assumptions that create the conflict. We then looked at an example conflict and saw how to use the Evaporating Cloud to resolve it.</p><p>We saw that the Evaporating Cloud is a powerful tool to constructively resolve conflicts so that they don't resurface in a slightly different form shortly after. Moreover, it is a tool that can be used in many situations, not only in conflicts.</p><h2>Additional Information</h2><p>You can find more about the Evaporating Cloud and other structured visual thinking methods on <a href="https://www.vithanco.com">www.vithanco.com</a>.

Please note that the one requirement is that both sides share the same goal. If needed, refer to the goals behind the current plan.</p><p>ECs allow a precise Problem description. ECs define a problem as a 'Common Objective', two separate 'Needs' and two different 'Wants' that conflict.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/EC-start.png"/><p class="caption"> <em>The Evaporating Cloud's basic structure</em></p><p>Use ECs whenever you have a problem.</p><p>ECs are methodically used in TOC thinking processes when defining a Future Reality Tree (FTRs). First, FTRs are created by injecting solutions from Current Reality Trees (CRT). Then, those solutions are formulated through ECs.</p><h2>Example EC</h2><p>Goldratt developed TOC based on production inefficiencies. One of his most often used examples is batch sizes and the perceived conflict between cost-saving large batch sizes and throughput-improving small batch sizes. The resulting EC with some false assumptions is shown below.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/Goldratts-EC.png"/><p class="caption"> <em>Goldratt's EC example</em></p><p>These assumptions are easier to find when the diagram is verbalised by stating each connection even aloud by constructing “In order to... we must ...". So, the assumptions here violate the phrase “In order to reduce setup cost per unit, we must run <em>large</em> batches." Notice the wording "we must". It invites critics.</p><h2>EC Notation Description</h2><p>The diagram below describes the Notation.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/domain-EC.jpg"/><p class="caption"> <em>The EC Notation Model</em></p><p>The Node Types in detail:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Node Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Is Starting Type / Successor</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common Objective</td><td>The shared Objective, valid for both branches of the EC</td><td>No / -</td></tr><tr><td>Need</td><td>The perceived Need</td><td>No / Common Objective</td></tr><tr><td>Want</td><td>The perceived Want</td><td>No / Need, And&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Conflict</td><td>The perceived Conflict, expressed as mutually exclusive wants</td><td>No / Want, And</td></tr><tr><td>And</td><td>Combining two elements that are necessary in combination.</td><td>No / All besides Assumptions and Solution</td></tr><tr><td>Assumption</td><td>Expose the underlying assumptions for the EC</td><td>Yes / Conflict, Want, Need</td></tr><tr><td>Solution</td><td>In order to mark the final solution</td><td>No / Need</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Evaporating Cloud uses <a href="https://vithanco.com/diagram-logic">Necessary Condition</a>, which can be expressed by statements like “To achieve ... we must provide ...".</p><h2>Background on Evaporating Clouds</h2><p>Evaporating is the most controversial and most powerful of the thinking processes. You should listen to the audio recording of Eli Goldratt in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/172800.Beyond_the_Goal">Beyond the Goal.</a> He explains his thinking and the background. My understanding of the EC goes along these lines:</p><ul><li>As long as two people/groups have the same goal, there cannot be a situation where an unresolvable conflict occurs. If you do not share the same purpose, a dispute will typically not be resolved. However, in most cases, it will be possible to find a shared goal if you look at the goals beyond the goal. So, instead of "Marketing needs a budget of XUSD", you go to the next level and agree that you want the best for the Marketing department (the budget was only a way to achieve this goal), or even what is the best for the company as a whole.</li><li>A conflict in this sense is a situation where two people/groups think their course of action or ideas are incompatible. So group A might think we should do "step 27" in the governance process "Vienna”, and group B believes not.</li><li>Whenever a conflict is identified, don't compromise because in a compromise, both sides lose, and (see above) it's optional. It would be like having two scales, with varying measures for the same item, and you start compromising (4kg or 2kg? Let's say it weighs 3kg). Goldratt suggests instead looking at what scale is misfunction or if both work and whether the concept of weight is right in this situation. Do whatever is needed but resolve the conflict. The item has only one weight and won't be found by compromises.</li><li>Goldratt's theory is that conflicts occur due to implicit assumptions. If you can identify the underlying assumptions, will you be able to find the flaws in one or both opposing approaches?</li></ul><p>From my perspective, I see ECs following [Einstein's (supposed?) approach to fixing a problem in <a href="http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/determining-the-proper-question">one hour</a> spending the most time (first 55 minutes) on defining the problem and then using the rest on solving the issue. This might be extreme time distribution, and the quote most likely doesn’t even come from Einstein, but I believe the idea is correct. Define the problem first and do it well; any solution will be much easier. And that is ultimately what one does with ECs. A well-constructed EC is a precise problem description.

They help to define the vocabulary by setting all relevant terms into relation to each other.</p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/kneupner.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Unsaved-Vithanco-Concept-Maps-Document.jpg?resize=660%2C249&ssl=1"/><p class="caption"> <em>What is a Concept Map?</em></p><p>Such a way of defining a vocabulary is (to my experience) superior to a traditional dictionary where you find a paragraph regarding the meaning of a word. Why? Simply because I have never seen anyone reading a 10 page document of definitions without the mind wandering off. A Concept Map in contrast is something that everyone can concentrate on. And by creating verifiable sentences you can double-check each relationship in a simple and constructive way. Just create a set of concept maps and take every new project member through each relationship. You will be able to align the meaning of the terms. What if the other person disagrees on a sentence? Great! You just hit a misalignment that might become problematic at a later stage. Align on how to use the terms. As I said, it’s a communication tool.</p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/kneupner.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jedi-3.png?resize=660%2C413&ssl=1"/><p class="caption"> <em>An outdated annotated Screenshot</em></p><h2>Notation Definition</h2><p>The Graph below describes the Concept Map Notation. Concept Maps have basically only two Node Types:</p><ol><li>Concepts</li><li>Relations</li></ol><p>You normally start with one or more concepts and then start expanding the map by adding more relations between concepts and by adding more relevant concepts. In order to emphasise a few concepts the Notation has a second Concept node: the Emphasised Concept. It comes with a different colour. If you use is sparingly the you will be able to highlight the most relevant concepts.</p><img src="https://vithanco.com/images/domain-Concept-Maps.jpg"/><p class="caption"> <em>The Concept Map Notation</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Node Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Is Starting Point</th><th>Successors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Concept</td><td>Concepts (or Terms) are nouns.

It's time to explain the future developments.</p><p>The rebranding became necessary when Apple changed the App Store Rules and my existing names became too long for the new rules. I needed to shorten the name although I liked the rather verbose "Visual Thinking" branding. After some thinking I decided on "Visual Thinking and Communication" or in short: "Vithanco". I really like the new name, because it really stands for how I think about these applications. They are tools for thinking and tools for communication. And since I was working on it, I worked on a new logo.</p><img src="logo.png" alt="logo 2880x1800"/><p>Along with the rebranding came new features I had already been working on. Keyboard control, spell checking, performance improvements (now diagrams with 100+ nodes are as fast as diagrams with 10 nodes), and clusters.</p><p>This was the easy part. I made one more decision that needed more consideration. I will switch from several small applications to one application. I intend to update the one Domain applications that I have going forward. But my main focus will be on Vithanco - the generic App. The different diagrams that you can create with the IBIS, Concept Maps, or TOC variants will be part of the new App (in fact you will be able to open them in the generic application). The variants are basically "Notations" within Vithanco. Each diagram will be created according to a particular Notation.</p><img src="images/Tools/Vithanco-Overview.jpg"/><p class="caption"> <em>A Concept Map depicting key concepts of Vithanco</em></p><p>New Domains will be included into Vithanco. The first new Notation will be based on the <a href="https://kneupner.de/visual-thinking-library/benefit-realisation">benefit realisation approach</a> that I mentioned earlier. More Notations will follow.</p><p>The Notation and Node Type Editor will be only fully functioning in the generic application going forward. I will hence take this functionality from the TOC variant.</p><p>With Vithanco I will change the payment model from pay in advance to Freemium. Flying Logic is the only similar software that I know. It sells for 249USD. I think that is a too high price upfront for private users. Hence, you can try it for free for 2 months before you will be charged 2.99 USD per month. If you don't want to use it, you cancel the subscription. This way -ignoring net present value- you will need to use it for 7 years before you pay the same. Updates won't cost you extra, new Notations won't cost extra. I hope others see this as well as a fair deal.</p><p>Vithanco will be released in the coming weeks. I can't wait to see it on the App Store.</p><p>Lastly, I am now creating <a href="http://vithanco.com">Vithanco.com</a> as a new home for the application. I will transfer all software related content there going forward.</p><p><strong>Update: 04.8.2023:</strong> updated content slightly to adjust to new names etc. (Like "Notation" instead of "Domain")</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/tools/History/visual-thinking-theory-constraints</guid><title>Visual Thinking with Theory of Constraints</title><description></description><link>https://vithanco.com/tools/History/visual-thinking-theory-constraints</link><pubDate>Fri, 4 Aug 2017 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a big fan of Theory of Constraints (TOC). I read the book "The Goal" years ago - actually after I was presented the great application <a href="https://kneupner.de/flying-logic-for-visual-thinking">"Flying Logic"</a>. Ever since then was I wondering why Flying Logic is so expensive. It is such a great tool and so applicable to many kind of issues - but simply too expensive. When I was starting with the Visual Thinking for IBIS application did i have Flying Logic in mind. I wanted a Mac tool that is similar to Flying Logic, but easier to use.</p><p>I have now done a big step in that direction. I have released the first version of "<a href="https://vithanco.com/tools">Vithanco TOC</a>". It is an early release as the visual language is more complex and will need some adjustments. Next problem is that TOC has several different diagram types and the app needs to cater for it. But, I have a workable first version.</p><p>Please add comments to the project page.</p><p>Currently supported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_processes_(theory_of_constraints)">thinking processes</a> are:</p><ul><li>Transition Tree (TRT or TT)</li><li>Future Reality Tree (FRT)</li><li>Current Reality Tree (CRT)</li><li>Evaporating Cloud (sometimes: conflict resolution diagram or CRD)</li><li>Prerequisite Tree (PRT)</li></ul><p>If you want to understand these thinking processes, please consider finding or buying a copy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/732158.Thinking_for_a_Change">Lisa Scheinkopf's "Thinking for a change"</a> from 1999. A quick overview of these is available in my mind map that I did on the topic of <a href="https://kneupner.de/portfolio/theory-of-constraints">Theory of Constraints</a>.</p><p>Please give me feedback on my software. What process to add next? Where is the graphical language not what you would have expected? I am happy to change directions to take in user feedback - and above is the proof. Thanks to all that are sending me feedback in advance.</p><p><strong>Update: 26.7.2023:</strong> updated the link</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vithanco.com/tools/History/visual-thinking-with-concept-maps</guid><title>Visual Thinking with Concept Maps</title><description></description><link>https://vithanco.com/tools/History/visual-thinking-with-concept-maps</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2017 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been able to use the Visual Thinking with IBIS code in order to create another useful little program: An editor for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map">Concept Maps</a>.

                <div class="content"><p>If you ever worked in a complex environment then you know that it's not that easy to find the root cause for an issue. What do you do find the root cause for an issue? Fishbone diagram? Sharp Thinking? Trial &amp; Error? <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/vithanco/p/the-power-of-perseverance-unleashing">5 Whys</a>?</p><p>Finding your Leverage Point is maybe the most versatile of them all! The starting point is slightly different from other approaches. Instead of looking at one problem in isolation, Find your Leverage Point is looking at the whole environment and identifies the point with the highest leverage. This makes sense as most issues are interconnected. And here is the fundamental difference to most other approaches. Most other approaches are looking at a single problem and help you fixing that particular issue. You will feel good about fixing an issue, but you might not see any change in the big scheme of things.</p><h2>Simplicity</h2><p>The idea behind Find you Leverage Point is from Eliyahu Goldratt. His believe was that in any system only a few things needs to be changed in order to improve the situation significantly. The theory of constraints is one of his examples for this. Here he showed how work on a single point (the constraint) leads to improvements of the whole system. (see for example <a href="/notations/TOC/index">my introduction to TOC</a>. The full idea regarding simplicity is nicely written down in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Choice_(Goldratt_book)">The Choice</a>.</p><p>He claims, and the book makes the case for it, that all problems are ultimately easier to solve than expected if only looked at from the right angle. And if you have a longer number of issues than these can be traced back to one or a few root issues. Fix the root issue(s) and the whole situation improves. That root issue is the leverage point you want to find. And this is what this article is about.</p><h2>Current Reality Tree (CRT) Explained</h2><p>As always, a good method needs the right notation. In this case, we are going to use the Current Reality Tree (CRT). The CRT is a problem-solving tool developed by Eliyahu Goldratt, the creator of the Theory of Constraints (TOC). A CRT is a graphical representation of the current reality, showing the undesirable effects (UDEs) that are experienced by a system, as well as the underlying causes of those UDEs.</p><p>CRTs are used to identify the root causes of problems, and to develop solutions that address those root causes. They are a powerful tool for systems thinking, and can be used to improve the performance of any system, from a small business to a large organization.</p><p>CRTs are basically differentiating between two types of things: things that can change and things that cannot.</p><p>To create a CRT, you first identify the Undesired Effects (UDEs) that you are experiencing. These are the symptoms of the problem that you are trying to solve. Once you have identified the UDEs, you can begin to identify the underlying causes. These are the factors that are contributing to the UDEs.</p><p>CRTs are typically drawn as a tree, with the UDEs at the top, and the underlying causes at the bottom. The underlying causes are connected to the UDEs by arrows, which show the causal relationships between them.</p><p>Once you have created a CRT, you can begin to develop solutions to the problem. The solutions should address the root causes of the problem, not just the symptoms. By addressing the root causes, you can achieve lasting improvement.</p><p>Here are some of the benefits of using CRTs:</p><p>They help you to identify the root causes of problems. They help you to develop solutions that address the root causes of problems. They help you to improve the performance of systems. They help you to think more systemically. They help you to communicate your ideas more effectively. If you are looking for a powerful tool for problem-solving, then the CRT is a great option. It is a simple tool to use, but it can be very effective in helping you to identify and address the root causes of problems.</p></div></article>

                <div class="content"><h2>Why Use Current Reality Trees (CRTs)?</h2><p>CRTs employ 'If... Then...' statements to address 'WHAT to change?' They serve as the initial step in applying the TOC thinking processes, leading to the discovery of the root cause – the single item to change for the most significant impact.</p><p>Essentially, CRTs are a form of root cause analysis. They assume that even if numerous problems exist in a specific area, they all stem from one or a few root causes. CRTs model the cause-and-effect relationship between these problems (known as "Undesirable Effects" or UDEs) and their causes.</p><p>What sets CRTs apart from other root cause analysis methods is the underlying <a href="/tools/Help/Expert-Concepts/diagram-logic">sufficient cause</a> or <a href="/tools/Help/Expert-Concepts/diagram-logic">diagram logic</a>. In the diagram, each edge A -&gt; B must be verifiable as "if A, then B."</p><p>The process is complete when all UDEs are connected, and you can identify the single effect that requires modification for the most significant impact.</p><h2>CRT Notation Description</h2><p>The diagram below outlines the Notation's grammar. CRTs begin by listing the known Undesirable Effects (UDEs) in a specific area. It is recommended to collect between 5 and 10, but more can be included if necessary.</p><p>Next, follow the sufficient cause logic to identify the causes. Each cause is an effect in itself (desirable, undesirable, or intermediate). Two additional "causes" typically appear at the bottom of the diagram: "Given" causes, which cannot be changed, and "Changeable" causes, which can and should be altered to mitigate problems from reoccurring. These are the most interesting causes since changing them is the easiest way to enact change.</p><img src="/images/domain-CRT-2.jpg"/><p>The Node Types in detail:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Node Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Is Starting Point</th><th>Successors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Undesirable Effect</td><td>Undesirable Effects (UDE) are the Starting Node Types for current reality trees. List them first, with a suggestion of between 5-10. They are caused by other effects or causes.</td><td>Yes</td><td>All Effects incl. 'And'</td></tr><tr><td>Intermediate Effect</td><td>Effects that are neither negative nor positive on their own. They are caused by other effects or causes.</td><td>No</td><td>All Effects incl. 'And'</td></tr><tr><td>Desirable Effect</td><td>A wanted effect. Reinforce this one and eliminate negative consequences. They are caused by other effects or causes.</td><td>No</td><td>All Effects incl. 'And'</td></tr><tr><td>Given</td><td>Given entities are beyond your sphere of influence. Sometimes referred to as Preconditions, they are always tree entries (with no predecessors). E.g., Gravity is given, and unless you leave Earth, it remains a constant force.</td><td>No</td><td>All Effects incl. 'And'</td></tr><tr><td>Changeable</td><td>Changeable entities are causes that can and should be changed to prevent problems from reoccurring.</td><td>No</td><td>All Effects incl. 'And'</td></tr><tr><td>And Junctor</td><td>In a sufficient cause diagram, each cause alone creates connected effects. The 'And' Junctor connects two causes, expressing that an event only occurs if both causes are present.</td><td>No</td><td>All</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Notation setting will highlight those effects (desirable, undesirable or intermediate incl. And Junctor) that are connected to a cause. This way the not-yet-connected effects are highlighted, so you can focus on them.</p><h2>Background Information on CRT Notation</h2><p>CRT diagrams were developed as part of the Theory of Constraints by E. Goldratt. More on Theory of Constraints can be found <a href="https://vithanco.com/Notations/the-theory-of-constraint-toc-thinking-processes">here</a>.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>In the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157385.It_s_Not_Luck">It's not Luck</a> Goldratt's hero Alex Rogo is creating a medium-sized <a href="https://vithanco.com/domains/the-theory-of-constraint-toc-thinking-processes/the-current-reality-tree-crt-domain">Current Reality Tree</a>. I re-created the CRT in Vithanco.</p><img src="/images/CRT-Example-from-Its-no-Luck.png"/><p><em>The CRT from "It's not Luck"</em></p><p>When creating the tree from the book I realised a few things:</p><ul><li>Goldratt didn't fully define the tree in the book. I needed to make some connections up for myself. Please let me know if I went wrong.</li><li>Goldratt didn't connect UDE #11 at all. If you have read the book then you know that it was the task of Alex Rogo to connect all UDEs.</li><li>This seems to me to be the obvious example CRT. However, I couldn't find anyone who had published this example.</li></ul><p>Fun fact: I only recently read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157385.It_s_Not_Luck">It's not Luck</a> for the first time. This is actually quite funny as I have used the <a href="https://vithanco.com/domains/the-theory-of-constraint-toc-thinking-processes">TOC Thinking Processes</a> for quite some time but I was simply not aware that they were presented in this book by Goldratt. Instead I read the <a href="http://flyinglogic.com/docs/Thinking%20with%20Flying%20Logic.pdf">Thinking with Flying Logic</a> a manuscript that is delivered together with the really good <a href="http://flyinglogic.com">Flying Logic</a> software (which was a huge influence for Vithanco). Furthermore did I read Lisa Scheinkopf's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/732158.Thinking_for_a_Change">Thinking for a Change.</a> I even read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40027950-the-logical-thinking-process">Dettmer's executive version book</a>.</p><p>However, I am happy that I now read the book as it is a useful introduction. Clearly, the book has a message and is therefore not a true novel and some of the examples are more questionable than others, but that is besides the point. I highly recommend the book.</p></div></article>

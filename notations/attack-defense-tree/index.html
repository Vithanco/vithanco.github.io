                <div class="content"><h2>Why Use Attack-Defense Trees (ADTrees)?</h2><p>Attack-Defense Trees (ADTrees) are a methodology for graphical security modelling and assessment. They extend the well-known formalism of attack trees by allowing nodes that represent defensive measures to appear at any level of the tree. This makes ADTrees suitable for representing the ongoing interaction between an attacker and a defender.</p><p>Classic attack trees, popularised by Bruce Schneier in 1999, model attack scenarios as tree-like structures where the root represents an attacker's goal and the leaves are the individual actions to achieve it. However, attack trees cannot capture the interplay between attacks and defenses. ADTrees overcome this limitation by introducing defense nodes as countermeasures to attacks, allowing you to model the arms race between attacker and defender in a single diagram.</p><p>ADTrees have two key structural features:</p><ul><li><strong>Refinements</strong>: Every node may have one or more children of the same type representing sub-goals. Refinement is either disjunctive (any one child suffices) or conjunctive (all children are required, modelled using an And Junctor).</li><li><strong>Countermeasures</strong>: Every node may also have one child of the opposite type. An attack node can have a defense child representing a countermeasure, and vice versa. This alternation between attack and defense can continue to any depth.</li></ul><p>The root of an ADTree determines whether the proponent is the attacker or the defender. When the root is a defense node, the overall goal is to protect the system, and attacks appear as threats to be countered. When the root is an attack node, the goal is to compromise the system, and defenses appear as obstacles.</p><h2>ADTree Notation Description</h2><p>ADTrees use two primary node types — Attack and Defense — plus an And Junctor for conjunctive refinement. Edges between nodes of the same type represent refinement (breaking a goal into sub-goals), while edges between nodes of opposite types represent countermeasures.</p><p>The Node Types in detail:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Node Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Is Starting Point</th><th>Successors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Attack</td><td>Represents an attacker's goal or action. Attack nodes can be refined into sub-goals (other attacks) and countered by defense nodes.</td><td>Yes (when root is an attack)</td><td>Attack, Defense, And Junctor</td></tr><tr><td>Defense</td><td>Represents a defender's goal or countermeasure. Defense nodes can be refined into sub-goals (other defenses) and challenged by attack nodes.</td><td>Yes (when root is a defense)</td><td>Attack, Defense, And Junctor</td></tr><tr><td>And Junctor</td><td>Indicates conjunctive refinement — all connected child conditions must be met for the parent goal to be achieved. Without an And Junctor, children are disjunctive (any one child suffices).</td><td>No</td><td>Attack, Defense</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The edges in an ADTree carry two distinct meanings depending on the types they connect:</p><ul><li><strong>Same-type edges</strong> (Attack to Attack, or Defense to Defense): Represent refinement of a goal into sub-goals.</li><li><strong>Cross-type edges</strong> (Defense to Attack, or Attack to Defense): Represent countermeasures — the child node counters the parent.</li></ul><h2>Background Information</h2><p>Attack-Defense Trees were formalised by Barbara Kordy, Sjouke Mauw, Saša Radomirović, and Patrick Schweitzer in their paper "Attack-defense trees" published in the Journal of Logic and Computation (2014, DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/logcom/exs029">10.1093/logcom/exs029</a>). The paper is also available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268018467_Attack-defense_trees">ResearchGate</a>.</p><p>ADTrees build on Bruce Schneier's original attack trees (1999), which provided a systematic way to evaluate the security of complex systems. By adding defense nodes, ADTrees generalise and unify existing approaches to extending attack trees, making them a more complete tool for security analysis.</p><h2>Try ADTree Yourself</h2><p>Create and visualise your own Attack-Defense Tree diagram right here in your browser.

The root node is a defense ("Data Confidentiality"), meaning the proponent is the defender.</p><img src="/images/notations/ADTree/ADTree.svg"/><p class="caption"> <em>An ADTree for protecting data confidentiality (from Kordy et al., 2014)</em></p><p>The hosting company needs both network security and physical security (conjunctive refinement via And Junctor) to protect data confidentiality. However, even with both in place, employee attacks (corruption or social engineering) remain a threat, countered by screening and sensitivity training respectively.</p><p>Network security is refined into access control and firewalls. Access control relies on passwords, which can be attacked through dictionary attacks — countered by requiring strong passwords. Strong passwords in turn face their own attacks: finding written-down notes or reusing passwords from other compromised accounts.</p><p>Physical security faces break-in attacks through back doors or fire escapes. Back doors are countered by locks, which themselves can be defeated by forcing them open or acquiring keys. Security guards counter break-ins but can be defeated through bribery, overpowering, or stealing their keys. Video cameras serve as a countermeasure to defeating the guard. Overpowering requires both outnumbering and using weapons (conjunctive refinement).</p><p>This example demonstrates how ADTrees capture the layered interaction between attack and defense strategies, making security trade-offs visible and analysable.</p></div></article>
